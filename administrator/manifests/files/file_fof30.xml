You might wonder, are these people at Akeeba drunk? This is a library, why do they use a "files" extension type?

No, we are not drunk but Joomla! sure is. When applying an update to a library package Joomla! will uninstall it
BEFORE it executes the installation script's preflight event. This means that any checks made there to prevent the
installation (e.g. wrong PHP or Joomla! version, or even preventing an accidental downgrade) results in the library
being UNINSTALLED. This means that when you try to install an unsupported version of a package extension that bundles
a library, your site CRASHES AND BURNS instead of the installation failing gracefuly. This is a catastrophic failure
mode that counts as a Priority 1 ("drop everything and fix it") bug. Unfortunately, for Joomla! this is business as
usual. It is a known issue since ~2017 but nobody will fix it until Joomla! 4.0 is released. Which means mid-2019 at
the earliest.

The only thing we can do to prevent your sites from burning to the ground if you try to install a version of our
software which does not support your PHP and/or Joomla! versions is to deliver our library as a *files* package. This
is nonsensical, it is 100% architecturally wrong BUT it is also the only way we can apply pre-installation checks which
fail gracefully instead of causing your site to crash and burn.
