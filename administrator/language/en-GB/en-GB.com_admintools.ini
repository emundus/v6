COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_LBL_SPAMMERMESSAGE_TIP="Allows you to show a specific message to blocked IP addresses. You may want to explain to the user that his IP was blocked because suspicious activity was detected as originating from his IP address. You can use the special text [IP] in all capital letters, without spaces between the brackets and IP, to display the user's IP in the message. This may be useful if someone gets accidentally blocked and asks you to help them."

COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_LBL_TSRBANNUM="Block for this long"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_LBL_TSRBANNUM_TIP="How long the block will last. For example, setting it to 1 day will block all access from this IP address for a whole day."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_LBL_TSRENABLE="IP blocking of repeat offenders"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_LBL_TSRENABLE_TIP="When set to yes, the IP address of repeat offenders will be automatically banned based on the rest of the settings"

COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_LBL_TSRSTRIKES="Block after"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_LBL_TSRSTRIKES_TIP="Chose how many attacks have to happen within how much time. For example, if you set it to 3 attacks in 1 hour, Admin Tools will ban a IP address from which at least 3 attacks have been blocked within the last hour."

COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_ADMINLOGINFOLDER_ALERT="In order to use this feature you have to enable the <strong>Search Engine Friendly URLs</strong> and <strong>Use URL rewriting</strong> options inside Joomla configuration page."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_ADMINLOGINFOLDER_TIP="For instance, if you enter the word <code>test</code> here you will only be able to access your site's administrator area with a URL similar to <code>http://www.example.com/test</code>. If you try to access it as <code>http://www.example.com/administrator</code> you will be redirected to the site's home page. Please note that after visiting the secret URL with your browser you will then be able to visit <code>http://www.example.com/administrator</code> without being blocked until your session expires. If you do not wish to use this feature, leave this field blank."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_ADMINPW="Administrator secret URL parameter"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_ADMINPW_TIP="For example, if you enter 'test', then you will only be able to access your administrator area by typing the URL <code>http://www.example.com/administrator/index.php?test</code>. <strong>WARNING! IT MUST START WITH A LETTER, NOT A NUMBER</strong>. For better compatibility across servers, please use lowercase ASCII characters and numbers only (a-z, 0-9)."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_ALLOWSITETEMPLATE="Allow site templates"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_ALLOWSITETEMPLATE_TIP="Enabling this option partially overrides the previous option (the blocking of template=foo in the URL). If the template= URL query parameter specifies the name of a template which exists in your template directory, then it will be allowed without causing request to be blocked. This is required only on sites which are using more than one template at the same time."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_ANTISPAM="Anti-spam filtering based on Bad Words list"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_ANTISPAM_TIP="When enabled, all requests containing at least one word in the <a href='%s'>Bad Words</a> list will be blocked."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_BBHTTPBLKEY="<a href='http://www.projecthoneypot.org/httpbl_configure.php' target='_blank'>Project Honeypot</a> HTTP:BL Key"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_BBHTTPBLKEY_TIP="Enter your HTTP:BL key. You can sign up for Project Honeypot and get your key at <a href='http://www.projecthoneypot.org/httpbl_configure.php'>http://www.projecthoneypot.org/httpbl_configure.php</a>."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_BLOCKEDEMAILDOMAINS="Email domains"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_BLOCKEDEMAILDOMAINS_TIP="Enter one domain for each line. Admin Tools will allow or block registration accordingly to the above field. Leave it empty to disable any restriction during user registration."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_CUSTGENERATOR="Customise the generator meta tag"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_CUSTGENERATOR_TIP="All Joomla! installations set the meta generator tag, a piece of HTML in the header of all pages, to advertise the fact that your site is running on Joomla!. This information is cached by search engines and is exploited by attackers to deduce that your site is running Joomla! when looking for potential targets. Enabling this option allows you to set a custom value for the generator tag in the next option. Be inventive!"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_DEACTIVATEUSERS="Deactivate user after"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_DEACTIVATEUSERS_TIP="Admin Tools can optionally deactivate existing user accounts when there are multiple failed attempts to log in using their username, protecting user accounts from brute force attacks. In here you can specify the number of failed logins and the time period these have to occur before the user is deactivated, e.g. 3 failed logins in 1 minute."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_DFISHIELD="Direct File Inclusion shield (DFIShield)"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_DFISHIELD_TIP="When this option is enabled, Admin Tools will search the request parameters for anything which looks like a file path. If one is found, it will be scanned. If it is found to contain PHP code, the request will be rejected."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_EMAILADMINFAILEDLOGIN="Email this address on failed administrator login"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_EMAILADMINFAILEDLOGIN_TIP="Enter an email address to be notified upon an unsuccessful login of anyone in your site's administrator backend. Leave blank to not be sent a notification. Make sure your site can send out emails first!"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_EMAILADMINLOGIN="Email this address on successful backend login"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_EMAILADMINLOGIN_TIP="Enter an email address to be notified upon a successful login of anyone in your site's administrator backend. Leave blank to not be sent a notification. Make sure your site can send out emails first!"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_EMAILBREACHES="Email this address on blocked request"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_EMAILBREACHES_TIP="Enter an email address to be notified upon any request blocked on your site. Leave blank to not be sent a notification. Make sure your site can send out emails first!"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_EMAILTHROTTLE="Enable blocked requests email throttling"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_EMAILTHROTTLE_TIP="When enabled the frequency of emails sent by Admin Tools can be throttled down. See the Email Templates for the maximum email frequency settings."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_HTTPBLBLOCKSUSPICIOUS="Also block suspicious IPs, not just confirmed spammers"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_HTTPBLBLOCKSUSPICIOUS_TIP="Sometimes Project Honeypot is not sure if an IP belongs to a spammer or it's a hapless chap who clicked on the wrong link. In this case the IP is marked as \"suspicious\". The default behaviour is to not block these IPs. However, if you are receiving a lot of spam it's a good idea to enable this feature and block even \"suspicious\" IPs. Ultimately, some unfortunate users will be inadvertently blocked, so use this option with caution!"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_HTTPBLENABLE="Enable HTTP:BL filtering"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_HTTPBLENABLE_TIP="Enables the integration with <a href='http://www.projecthoneypot.org'>Project Honeypot</a>. <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: You need to register to Project Honeypot, get a key and enter it in the next option for this feature to work."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_HTTPBLMAXAGE="Maximum age of accepted HTTP:BL results"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_HTTPBLMAXAGE_TIP="Project Honeypot reports when was the last time this IP was caught sending spam messages. The older this is (the higher the age is), the less likely is that this IP is still used by a spammer. You can chose here what will be the maximum reported age that will be blocked. The default value of 30 means that IPs which have submitted a spam message in the last 30 days will be blocked."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_HTTPBLTHRESHOLD="Minimum Threat Rating to block (0-255, default 25)"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_HTTPBLTHRESHOLD_TIP="Project Honeypot uses a logarithmic \"threat rating\" to rank the possibility of a specific IP being a spammer. This options defines the minimum threat level an IP must have before it's blocked. A value of 25 means that this IP has submitted 100 spam messages on Project Honeypot's spam catching honeypots and is usually a safe indication that it belongs to a spammer. Do note that the rating is logarithmic. A value of 50 means 1,000 spam messages and a value of 75 means one million spam messages. Do not set it to values over 50, as you will most likely never block any spammer at all."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_IPBL="Disallow site access to IPs in the IP Disallow List"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_IPWL="Allow administrator access only to IPs in Exclusive Allow IP List"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_LOGBREACHES="Log blocked requests"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_LOGBREACHES_TIP="It is suggested to keep this option enabled. When enabled, all potential security breaches —blocked by Admin Tools— will be logged in the database and made available under the Blocked Requests Log tool."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_MUASHIELD="Malicious User Agent block (MUAShield)"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_MUASHIELD_TIP="Many hackers will try to access your site using a browser configured to send malicious PHP code in its user agent string (a small piece of text used to describe the browser to your server). The idea is that buggy log processing software will parse it and allow the hacker to gain control of your website. When enabled, this feature allows Admin Tools to detect such attacks and block the request."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_NOFESALOGIN="Forbid frontend Super Administrator login"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_NOFESALOGIN_TIP="When enabled, it will not be possible for Super Administrators to log in to your site's frontend. This is a security precaution against password brute forcing. Even users with Super User privileges will not be able to log the frontend of your site."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_NONEWADMINS="Disable editing backend users' properties"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_NONEWADMINS_TIP="When enabled, trying to modify the settings of an existing or create a new a Manager, Administrator or Super Administrator will fail."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_NONEWFRONTENDADMINS="Disable creating / editing backend users from the frontend"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_NONEWFRONTENDADMINS_TIP="You should normally be unable to create a new user with administrative backend login privileges from the public frontend. When this option is enabled it will treat attempts to create this kind of accounts as hacking attempts and block them from executing. This addresses some of the most notorious zero day attacks in Joomla! which took place between 2015 and 2016."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_REASONS_NOEMAIL="Do not send email notifications for these reasons"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_REASONS_NOEMAIL_TIP="Requests blocked by these reasons will not result in an email being sent to the email address specified in <em>Email this address on blocked request</em>"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_REASONS_NOLOG="Do not log these reasons"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_REASONS_NOLOG_TIP="Requests blocked by these reasons will not be logged. As a result, IPs triggering a blocked request repeatedly for this reason will not be automatically banned from your site. Moreover, as there is no log, it will be impossible to tell why someone is being blocked from accessing your site when they trigger one of those reasons."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_RESETJOOMLATFA="Disable Joomla!'s Two-Factor Authentication on password reset"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_RESETJOOMLATFA_TIP="When enabled, Admin Tools will disable the Joomla! Two Factor Authentication configuration for a user when they are resetting their password. This only applies to the built-in Joomla! 3.2 and later Two Factor Authentication feature, not the Two Factor Authentication feature of Admin Tools."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_RFISHIELD="Remote File Inclusion block (RFIShield)"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_RFISHIELD_TIP="Some hackers will try to force a vulnerable extension into loading PHP code directly from their server. This is done by passing an http(s):// or ftp:// URL in their request, pointing to their malicious site. When this option is enabled, Admin Tools will look for such cases, try to fetch the remote URL and scan its contents. If it is found to contain PHP code, it will block the request."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_SAVEUSERSIGNUPIP="Save user sign-up IP in User Notes"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_SAVEUSERSIGNUPIP_TIP="When enabled, the IP new users signed up from will be stored as User Notes. Users created through the backend will not have their IP saved as a User Note because it makes no sense to do so (it's an administrator registering the user account on their behalf). Third party components creating new user accounts may also not trigger the plugin event."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_SESSIONSHIELD="PHP session data poisoning protection (SessionShield)"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_SESSIONSHIELD_TIP="Prevents malicious input data which can be used to trick PHP's internal session handler into executing arbitrary code when it's restoring the user session. CAUTION: It <em>may</em> block some legitimate requests as well."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_SQLISHIELD="SQLiShield protection against SQL injection attacks"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_SQLISHIELD_TIP="When enabled, Admin Tools will try to detect common SQL injection attacks against your site and block them."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_TEMPLATE="Block template=foo site template switch"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_TEMPLATE_TIP="Another Joomla! hidden feature is the ability to switch between installed templates by passing a special URL parameter. For instance, if you want to apply the Beez5 template, just pass the parameter <code>?template=beez5</code>"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_TMPL="Block tmpl=foo system template switch"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_TMPLWHITELIST="List of allowed tmpl= keywords"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_TMPLWHITELIST_TIP="Use a comma separated list, e.g. component,system"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_TMPL_TIP="One of the lesser known Joomla! features are its system templates. Whenever an error occurs or you put your site offline, Joomla! loads the respective system template. Passing the name of the template in the URL by appending, say, ?tmpl=offline allows you to test those templates without having to actually produce an error or put your site off-line. Enabling this option will turn off this hidden Joomla! feature. Do note that tmpl=system and tmpl=component must be permitted (see next option), as they are required by some extensions to work."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_TRACKFAILEDLOGINS="Treat failed logins as a reason for blocking the request"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_TRACKFAILEDLOGINS_TIP="When enabled, failed login attempts of any kind of user (even simple registered users) count as a valid reason to block the request and are being logged in Admin Tools' Blocked Request Log. There is a very useful implication to that. Since they count as reasons to block a request they also count towards the limit you set up in the automatic IP blocking. Therefore, after a number of failed login attempts, the user's IP will be automatically blocked for the duration you have set up."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_LOGUSERNAMES="Log usernames"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_LOGUSERNAMES_TIP="When enabled, Admin Tools will include the username while tracking failed logins (see above). WARNING! We strongly suggest to keep this option disabled to avoid issues with GDPR"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_UPLOADSHIELD="Uploads scanner (UploadShield)"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_UPLOADSHIELD_TIP="When this option is enabled, Admin Tools will proactively scan all files which are uploaded through Joomla!. If any of these files is found to contain even a single line of PHP code, the request is blocked. Do note that not all servers support this feature. If the uploaded files directory is blocked by open_basedir restrictions, no scanning will take place."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_USE403VIEW="Show errors using a customisable HTML template"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_USE403VIEW_TIP="By default, the Blocked Request Message will be shown using Joomla!'s standard error message page. When this option is enabled, however, Admin Tools will use a customisable HTML template. The default HTML template file is located in the components/com_admintools/View/Blocks/tmpl/default.php file. DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE DIRECTLY! Read the documentation for the proper method to create a template override."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_WHITELIST_DOMAINS="Allowed domains"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_CONFIGUREWAF_OPT_WHITELIST_DOMAINS_TIP="If the IP address of the visitor whose request would be blocked resolves to a domain name ending in what you enter here they will not be blocked; their request will go through normally. Effectively, these domain names have a free pass on your site. Please note that a long list will cause a big performance impact. Enter a comma separated list of the domain names you want to allow. The default value is .googlebot.com,.search.msn.com which allows the search engine indexers Google Bot (used by Google Search) and MSN Bot (used by Bing)."

COM_ADMINTOOLS_TROUBLESHOOTEREMAIL_BODY_DESCRIPTION="You just %s using the Admin Tools component on your site “%s”. This is a generally safe process. In some cases a misunderstunding, an oversight, or a browser or server mangling your settings may result in your site not working properly or becoming inaccessible. This applies to both Joomla itself and its various third party extensions. In this unlikely event please consult the following URLs for troubleshooting instructions:"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_TROUBLESHOOTEREMAIL_BODY_SUPPORT="If you can not find a solution by yourself and you have an active subscription for Admin Tools please file a support ticket on our site, https://www.akeeba.com and tell us what you did before the issue occurred, what is the issue and which troubleshooting steps you have already tried."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_TROUBLESHOOTEREMAIL_BODY_WHOSENTTHIS="Who sent this email?"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_TROUBLESHOOTEREMAIL_BODY_WHOSENT_1="This email is sent automatically  by Admin Tools to the email address on record on your Joomla user profile every time you take an administrative action which could accidentally lock you out of your site. It is not sent to any other users of your site."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_TROUBLESHOOTEREMAIL_BODY_WHOSENT_2="If you no longer wish to receive these emails please log into your site's administrator backend and go to Components, Admin Tools, Web Application Firewall, Configure WAF and click on the Customisation tab. Find the “Send troubleshooting email on administrative functions” and set it to No."

The email contains links to the troubleshooting articles which help them rectify the issue and restore the site back to its working state. You are very advised to keep this feature enabled. Following the troubleshooting information is far faster than waiting for a reply back from our support."

COM_ADMINTOOLS_CPANEL_SERVERCONFIGWARN="Admin Tools detected that your server configuration file (ie .htaccess, nginx.conf or web.config) has been modified.

COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_JCONFIG_MAXEXEC_LABEL="Maximum Work Time"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_JCONFIG_MAXEXEC_DESC="Maximum amount of time consumed scanning your site in each request to the PHP File Change Scanner. Decrease if you hit your server's CPU / resource limits. Set lower than the Minimum Request Time to create a “CPU usage cool down” period, thereby reducing your resource usage during file scanning at the expense of making the scanning slower.<br/><br/>Recommended values: 3.0 to 7.0"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_JCONFIG_RUNTIMEBIAS_LABEL="Work Time Bias"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_JCONFIG_RUNTIMEBIAS_DESC="A value 50 to 100 which affects how aggressively Admin Tools will predict if it's about to hit the Maximum Work Time limit. 50 is most aggressive and will result in scanning taking about half of the Maximum Work Time in each request to the PHP File Change Scanner. 100 is the least aggressive and will result in scanning taking at least and usually more than the Maximum Work Time in each request.<br/><br/>Recommended value: 75.<br/><br/><strong>Tip!</strong> If you have a particularly sensitive server we recommend setting Minimum Request Time 7.0, Maximum Work Time 5.0 and Work Time Bias 50. This means that the scanner works for 2.5 to 5.0 seconds at a time and then your server does nothing for 2.0 to 4.5 seconds. Scanning your site will take about three times longer but it has a better chance of completing."

This is a limitation of how Operating Systems and their filesystem drivers work. It's nothing us, Joomla! or PHP can do about. You are strongly advised to exclude really big folders and take steps to prevent having folders with thousands of directly contained files and folders. If unsure, nest your folders deeply."

COM_ADMINTOOLS_JCONFIG_SCANIGNORENONTHREATS_DESC="When enabled, any new or modified file with a zero Threat Score will not be reported.<br/><br/>Recommended value: No<br/><br/><strong>WARNING</strong>: We do NOT recommend enabling this option. It is conceivable that maliciously modified files may have a zero Threat Score because their malicious payload is written in a way that is impossible for an automated scanner to distinguish from legitimate, if a bit messy, code. Enabling this option will not alert you of these files, possibly putting your site at risk. This option is here for debugging issues with the Threat Score calculation, NOT as something you should enable on production sites."
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_JCONFIG_OVERSIZEFILETHRESHOLD_LABEL="Oversize file threshold"
COM_ADMINTOOLS_LBL_JCONFIG_OVERSIZEFILETHRESHOLD_DESC="Files bigger than this many bytes will not have their Threat Score evaluated.<br/><br/>Recommended value: 5242880<br/><br/>A value too small would cause executable files to not be scanned for malicious code which could be a security concern. Setting this too high will probably result in a PHP timeout when scanning a very big file, typically one that's not even executable despite the .php extension (e.g. a log file)."
