PLG_SYSTEM_LOGINGUARD_CONFIG_2SVONSILENT_DESC="Should I show the Two Step Verification when Joomla performs a silent user login? Silent logins are those which do not require a username and password e.g. the Remember Me plugin, single sign on or login through social networks. Silent logins are detected through the Joomla authentication response type they provide. The list of silent authentication response types is defined in theoption below."

PLG_USER_LOGINGUARD_CONFIG_SILENTRESPONSES_LABEL="Silent login authentication response types (for experts)"
PLG_USER_LOGINGUARD_CONFIG_SILENTRESPONSES_DESC="A comma separated list of Joomla authentication response types which are considered silent logins. The default is <code>cookie, sociallogin, passwordless</code> which includes cookie logins (that's the Remember Me feature of Joomla), Akeeba SocialLogin and Passwordless (WebAuthn) logins. If you have a custom Joomla user authentication plugin which sets a different authentication response type you may want to add it to this list to prevent Two Step Verification from being shown in the option above is set to No."
