     * Rijndael-192 and Rijndael-256 algorithms with different block sizes. These are NOT used in AES. OpenSSL, however,
     * implements AES correctly. It always uses a 128-bit (16 byte) block. The 192 and 256 bit strengths refer to the
     * key size, not the block size. Therefore using different strengths in MCrypt and OpenSSL will result in different
     * and incompatible ciphertexts.
     *
     * TL;DR: Always use $strength = 128!
