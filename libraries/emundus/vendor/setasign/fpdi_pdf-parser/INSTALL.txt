The FPDI PDF-Parser is an extension of the PDF parser that is shipped with FPDI by default.

Just extract the content of this package to a folder of your choice and add the /src folder
to your PSR-4 autoload implementation:

    $loader = new \Example\Psr4AutoloaderClass;
    $loader->register();
    $loader->addNamespace('setasign\FpdiPdfParser', 'path/to/src/');

If you do not have a PSR-4 autoloader class in use, just require the
autoload file manually:

    require_once('path/to/src/autoload.php');

!! Always use the latest versions of both FPDI and the FPDI PDF-Parser !!
!! and make sure that you do not mix the contents of both src/ folders !!


FOR EVALUATION VERSIONS ONLY
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
An evaluation package is encoded with Ioncube.
This requires a loader to be installed on your server.

An evaluation version is separated into two parts: The PHP files and a license file.

License files are named .htFPDI_PDF-Parser.icl

	NOTICE THE DOT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FILENAME!
	SOME SYSTEMS (MAC) AUTOMATICALLY HIDE SUCH FILES!

The needed loaders and installation instruction for the Ioncube Loader are available at:

    http://www.ioncube.com/loaders.php

We reccomend to use the "Loader Wizard" for installation (see instructions on the top of the page).

After the installation of the Ioncube Loader, place the license file into the /src directory
or an upper folder of the FPDI PDF-Parser and follow the default installation instructions.
