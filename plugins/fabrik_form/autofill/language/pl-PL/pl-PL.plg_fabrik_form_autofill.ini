Looks up artist, and puts the artist name in the events title, and the artist bio and puts it in the forms 'events___description' field.

To map a single 'from' to multiple 'to' elements, use an array from the 'to' value, like [&quot;table___field1&quot;,&quot;table___field2&quot;]

Join records are now mapped with the full name(previously you had to append the full element name wth 'join__X____', and whilst this will still work it is no longer necessary
